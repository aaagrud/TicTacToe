# Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using JavaFX. The game allows a player to play against the computer.

## Overview

This application demonstrates the usage of JavaFX to create a graphical user interface for a Tic Tac Toe game. The game is played on a 3x3 grid where the player plays as 'X' and the computer plays as 'O'. The first player to align three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If the grid is completely filled without any player winning, the game ends in a tie.

## Features

- Single-player mode against the computer.
- Graphical user interface with JavaFX.
- Game reset functionality after a win or a tie.
